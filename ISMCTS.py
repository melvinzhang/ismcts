# This is a very simple Python 2.7 implementation of the Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm.
# The function ISMCTS(rootstate, itermax, verbose = False) is towards the bottom of the code.
# It aims to have the clearest and simplest possible code, and for the sake of clarity, the code
# is orders of magnitude less efficient than it could be made, particularly by using a 
# state.GetRandomMove() or state.DoRandomRollout() function.
# 
# An example GameState classes for Knockout Whist is included to give some idea of how you
# can write your own GameState to use ISMCTS in your hidden information game.
